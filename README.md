# :warning: IMPORTANT! :warning:
Some files were too big to be uploaded to GitHub. I was too lazy to look into LFS, so I put stuff in zip files. Before compiling, download and install [7-zip](https://www.7-zip.org/), select all of the `extractme` files in the project directory, right click, and click `7-Zip > Extract Here`. If you need further help compiling, use [this guide](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine/blob/0.5.1/README.md#installation).
